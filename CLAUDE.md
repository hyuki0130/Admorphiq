# CLAUDE.md — Admorphiq

## Project Overview

**Admorphiq** (Adaptive Morphing Intelligence) is an AI agent for the [ARC Prize 2026 — ARC-AGI-3](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2026-arc-agi-3) competition.

ARC-AGI-3 is the first **interactive reasoning benchmark** — agents must explore unfamiliar game environments, discover rules through trial and error, and adapt in real-time. Unlike static puzzles, this requires genuine fluid intelligence: exploration, hypothesis generation, planning, and learning from sparse feedback.

### Core Philosophy (François Chollet)

> "Intelligence = efficiency of skill acquisition in novel situations"

- Not memorization, not pattern matching on training data
- Few-shot rule discovery from interaction
- Human Core Knowledge as prior: object permanence, numeracy, geometry

### Constraints (Kaggle Environment)

| Constraint | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| CPU notebook | ≤ 6 hours runtime |
| GPU notebook | ≤ 6 hours runtime (T4 16GB VRAM) |
| Internet | **Disabled** (no external API calls) |
| External data | Freely available public data + pre-trained models OK |
| Submission | 1 per day |
| Open source | Required for prize eligibility |

**Key implication**: No Claude/GPT API calls. Must use offline models (quantized open-source LLMs on Kaggle GPU). Claude Code is dev-time only — final notebook ships with pre-downloaded open-weight model (candidate set under evaluation; see [LLM Selection](#llm-selection-phase-8-hypothesis-engine)).

### Layer Details

**Perception Layer** (implemented)
- Input: 16-channel one-hot encoded 64x64 frames
- CNN backbone (5-layer, 16→32→64→128→256 channels, 34M params)
- Dual head: action logits (5 actions) + coordinate logits (4096 = 64x64)
- Total output: 4101 logits, trained with BCEWithLogitsLoss

**World Model** (implemented, 1.6M params)
- StateEncoder: CNN-based state embedding from 16-channel frames
- ActionEmbedding: 8 action types + coordinate encoding
- TransitionPredictor: predicts residual delta (next_state = current + delta)
- ChangePredictor: binary classifier for state-change likelihood
- Experience buffer (~200K unique state-action pairs, MD5 dedup)
- Agent scoring: combined = alpha * perception + (1-alpha) * world_model (alpha=0.5)

**Hypothesis Engine** (planned — Phase 8 integration, **model undecided, pending benchmark**)

Candidates to evaluate (all Apache 2.0 or equivalent, Kaggle-compatible):
- **Qwen 3 8B** (dense, ~5GB 4bit) — strong 8B-class reasoning, best LoRA ecosystem (favored if TTT needed)
- **Gemma 4 26B MoE** (3.8B active / 26B total, ~13GB 4bit) — 31B-tier reasoning (AIME 89.2% / GPQA 84.3%), fast MoE inference (favored for Wiki zero-shot)
- **Gemma 4 E4B** (4.5B effective, ~3GB 4bit) — low-VRAM fallback, long 128K context
- **Llama 3.1 8B** — weaker reasoning vs Qwen 3 / Gemma 4; reference-only, not a candidate

Selection rule: choose empirically after Phase 8 Step 3 benchmark. Each candidate tested on identical Wiki-pattern zero-shot task (game classification + strategy selection) against the 25-game regression. See [LLM Selection](#llm-selection-phase-8-hypothesis-engine) for full matrix.

Option B: Program synthesis — generate candidate rule programs (DSL primitives)
Option C: Neurosymbolic — neural intuition + symbolic rule extraction

**Action Planner** (implemented in AdmorphiqAgent + EnsembleAgent)
- Hierarchical sampling: action type first, then coordinates if ACTION6
- Entropy regularization to encourage exploration
- Change prediction bias: prefer actions likely to cause state changes
- Level transition detection with automatic buffer/model reset
- Ensemble dispatch: 60+ generic strategies + game-specific analytical solvers

## Game Environment

### Agent Interface
- Two required methods: `is_done()` and `choose_action(frame_data)`
- `FrameData` contains: `frame[N][64][64]` (variable layers, int8 color index per cell), `available_actions`, `state`, `levels_completed`
- **Frame structure** (corrected): NOT fixed 16ch one-hot. Games have variable layer count (1~N), each cell is an int8 color index. Our adapter converts to 16ch one-hot for the CNN.
- `GameAction`: RESET=0, ACTION1-5 (simple, no coordinates), ACTION6 (complex, requires x/y), ACTION7 (simple, cancel/undo)
- `MAX_ACTIONS = 80` per game (ensemble strategies use larger budgets internally)

### Scoring
- Per-game: 0~100% (100% = matching human-level performance)
- Final: average across all games
- Capped at 100% even if agent uses fewer moves than humans

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Environment Understanding ✅ Complete
- ~~Install arc-agi SDK, set up local development~~
- ~~Play games manually to understand structure~~
- ~~Study official framework (arcprize/ARC-AGI-3-Agents)~~
- ~~Analyze reference solution (DriesSmit/ARC3-solution)~~

### Phase 2: Baseline Agent ✅ Complete
- ~~CNN perception backbone (16→32→64→128→256, dual head, 34M params)~~
- ~~Experience buffer with MD5 hash deduplication (200K capacity)~~
- ~~AdmorphiqAgent with hierarchical sampling + entropy regularization~~
- ~~Type abstractions: GameState, ActionType, GameAction, FrameData~~
- ~~41 tests passing (types 8, perception 11, buffer 10, agent 12)~~

### Phase 2.5: SDK Integration + Live Testing ✅ Complete
- ~~arcengine 0.9.3 + arc-agi 0.9.6 installation and integration~~
- ~~AdmorphiqAdapter: official Agent ↔ internal Agent bridge~~
- ~~Frame conversion: multi-layer (1~N layers, int8 color index) → 16ch one-hot~~
- ~~scripts/run_local.py: local game runner~~
- ~~Live tested on 3 games (DC22/1L, LF52/2L, BP35/2L) — 0 levels cleared~~

### Phase 3: World Model ✅ Complete
- ~~StateEncoder (CNN) + ActionEmbedding (8 types + coordinates) + TransitionPredictor (residual delta)~~
- ~~ChangePredictor for smarter exploration (1.6M params total)~~
- ~~Agent integration: combined = alpha * perception + (1-alpha) * world_model~~
- ~~ExperienceBuffer extended with next_frame + sample_with_next()~~
- ~~69 tests passing (41 existing + 28 new)~~

### Phase 3.5: Exploration Strategy Improvement — Failed
- Level completion rewards (frame_changed=0.3, level_up=1.0, game_over=-0.5)
- SystematicExplorer (untried action bonus, forced traversal)
- GameMemory (success sequence replay)
- Hotfixes: explorer diversity, train_frequency=20, MAX_ACTIONS=500
- **Result**: 0 levels cleared on all 3 games despite 500 actions each
- **Conclusion**: Change prediction approach has fundamental architectural limitations

### Phase 4: Multi-Strategy Exploration ✅ Complete
- ~~4A: Graph-based exploration — state graph + BFS (agent_graph.py, graph_explorer.py)~~
- ~~4B: StochasticGoose improvements — binary reward, coord /4096 scaling, train_freq=5, perception only~~
- ~~4C: Frame diff engine — FrameAnalyzer + StateGraph + DiffAgent (agent_diff.py)~~
- ~~Game classification: 25 games auto-classified (movement 7, click 6, hybrid 6, transform 2, unknown 4)~~
- ~~Interactive play script (play.py)~~
- **Best result**: Frame diff solver cleared 4 games/4 levels (25 games in 25s)
- **Key insight**: Graph/Diff/CNN each clear different games — ensemble potential

### Phase 5: Maximize Game Clears ✅ Complete
- Cleared 16/25 games using all 4 approaches in parallel
- Game-specific analytical solvers introduced (lights-out, paint, maze BFS, etc.)
- Game internals access used for upper-bound performance measurement

### Phase 6: Generalization Refactoring ✅ Complete
- Removed ALL game-ID hardcoding from dispatch — 60+ generic strategies
- All triggers feature-based (available_actions + frame analysis)
- No game IDs in strategy names or conditions
- Analytical solvers retained internal access (Phase 8 will clean up)

### Phase 7: Multi-Level + Score Optimization ✅ Closed (post-rotation reality check, 2026-04-21)
- **Round 1 (2026-04-20, since-superseded baseline)**: 31/40 envs, 79/289 levels (27.34%).
- **2026-04-21 re-run, SAME code, SAME runner, 50K budget**: **28/40 envs, 54/290 levels (18.62%)**.
  The ARC Prize API rotated every env hash overnight; `su15-4c352900 → su15-1944f8ab` etc.
  Every brittle attr-reader (`strat_su15_vacuum`, `strat_re86_analytical`, `strat_ka59_sokoban`,
  `strat_s5i5_slider`, `zig3_A2A4`) silently dropped to 0. See
  `.wiki/wiki/lessons/api_hash_rotation_20260421.md`.
- **Lesson written in blood**: "v1 score" is not a stable metric. The previous 36.81% figure
  was a single-day snapshot tied to the 2026-04-20 hash set. It cannot be chased.
- **LF52/SK48 budget fix verified**: LF52 1/10 via `adaptive_c2`, SK48 1/8 via `sk48_snake`
  (both recovered from 0). Root cause was `total_budget=20000` in the runner starving late
  strategies; fix raised it to 50000 to match the class default.
- **All further Phase 7 work cancelled** — no more brittle solvers, no more hash-coupled
  hardcoding. Phase 8 (frame-only + LLM) is the only sustainable path.

### Phase 8: Generalization + Kaggle Submission 🔄 ACTIVE (Karpathy LLM-Wiki pattern)

**Architecture decision (2026-04-20)**: Adopt [Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) — markdown knowledge base maintained by LLM at dev-time, read by inference LLM at Kaggle-time. No vector DB (incompatible with Kaggle internet constraint).

### Wiki Doctrine (non-negotiable)

The wiki is **not a state dump**. It exists to let an offline LLM reason about a new game by retrieving:

1. **`concepts/`** — cross-game domain entities (merge mechanic, pushable block, version hash, frame hashing, ...)
2. **`lessons/`** — accumulated engineering wisdom from past incidents (v2 obfuscation, silent regression, brittle tells, ...)
3. **`debug/`** — failure-mode playbooks keyed on observable symptoms (attribute error, regression bisect, ...)
4. **`reasoning/`** — explicit observation → hypothesis → action chains (discovery phase, frame-to-strategy, hypothesis check)
5. **`games/` + `game_types/` + `strategies/`** — entity pages that link into the above

Every page answers: **What is this? How did we arrive at this claim (provenance)? What related pages should a reader consult? What would falsify this claim?**

Describe the **journey, not just the state**: "initially we thought X, observed Y, changed to Z". A page that records only the current snapshot is half-done.

**Cross-link aggressively.** Each new claim should cite ≥1 concept page, ≥1 lesson page, and ≥1 peer entity page when applicable.

See `.wiki/schema.md` for the write conventions and `memory/feedback_wiki_doctrine.md` for the full doctrine.

**Phase 8 RESTART (2026-04-21) — three-layer agent, dev/Kaggle split, R1-R6 loop**:

Binding architecture doc: **`.wiki/wiki/architecture.md`** (load-bearing — any change contradicting it updates the doc first). The pre-restart linear plan (Step 1-4 below, kept for traceability) capped at 15/40 envs / 36 levels / 45% classification on 2026-04-21 live-env run. Four structural gaps drove the restart: thin LLM input (5 features), thin LLM output (17/74 strategies exposed), no failure feedback loop, no regression gate.

**Three layers** (see `architecture.md` for full contract):
- **Cognition (LLM, Qwen 3 family)** — reasons, hypothesizes, reflects. Proposes code/wiki edits via JSON. Never writes code directly.
- **Memory (Wiki + Session)** — `.wiki/` long-term, append-only dev-time, frozen Kaggle-time. In-memory session dict at Kaggle-time tracks intra-run failures.
- **Action (Strategies)** — `agent_ensemble.py` functions. Dev-time: added/rewritten by Claude Code from LLM proposals. Kaggle-time: frozen.

**Boundary rule** (non-negotiable): Kaggle-time the only mutable layer is session state. Everything else ships as a frozen asset. Dev-time loop hardens the snapshot between submissions.

**Restart steps R1–R6**:

- [x] **R1 — Architecture doc** (`.wiki/wiki/architecture.md`, this commit). Defines 3 layers, dev/Kaggle split, dev loop, Kaggle loop, layer contracts, falsification criteria.
- [x] **R2 — Feature-rich DiscoveryReport** (2026-04-21). Added `dir_map`, `player_color`, `movable_region_count`, `click_responsive_cells`, `change_topology`, `color_histogram`, `symmetry_score`. Seven pure derive helpers (`_derive_*` + `_connected_components`) unit-tested via `tests/test_discovery_features.py` (23 tests). `Hypothesis` extended with `confidence` + `features_missing` so the LLM can flag what it needed but didn't get. Prompt template rewritten to expose all features. Full suite 126/126.
- [x] **R3 — Universal strategy dispatcher** (2026-04-21). `src/admorphiq/hypothesis/dispatcher.py` introspects `agent_ensemble` at registry-build time via `inspect.signature()` and auto-registers every `strat_*` whose non-default non-env non-budget params are keys of `CTX_KEYS`. **67/74 strategies now dispatchable** (was 17); the remaining 7 (`sustained`, `zigzag`, `extended_winner`, `continue_multilevel`, `move_click`, `navigate`, `graph_explore`) require runtime-only args (winning action ids, target colors) and stay in the internal ensemble dispatcher. WikiAgent builds ctx once per env via `build_ctx(report)` and passes it to each strategy call. 14 new unit tests in `tests/test_dispatcher.py`; full suite 140/140.
- [x] **R4 — Reflection module** (2026-04-21). Split into two tools after measured reality:
  - `scripts/analyze_trace.py` — **deterministic** pattern extraction (no LLM). Emits `scripts/trace_analysis.json` with headline stats, per-primary success rates, and flagged failure patterns (`dir_map_but_click_primary`, `wasted_budget_zero_levels`, `unknown_strategy_picks`, `llm_flagged_missing_features`, `movement_type_non_movement_primary`). 8 unit tests in `tests/test_analyze_trace.py`.
  - `scripts/reflect_wiki_agent.py` — LLM-assisted reflector (16 unit tests in `tests/test_reflection.py`). Works end-to-end mechanically but Qwen 3 8B/14B proved too weak for structured reflection on a 40-env trace (they drift into "describe the input" mode — documented as a measured falsification of the LLM-driven variant, not a regression to fix). Kept for future use with stronger models.
  - Architecture doc updated: **dev-time Cognition = Claude Code**, Qwen is Kaggle-time only. Claude Code reads `trace_analysis.json` and authors wiki/code proposals inline during a session — no intermediate LLM call required.
  - Full suite 164/164.
- [x] **R5 — Regression gate** (2026-04-21). `scripts/regression_gate.py` + `scripts/regression_baseline.json`. Compares new trace against baseline with two views: strict `by_game_id` (same title+hash, fails on drop), and informational `by_title` (best across hashes, logs but does not fail — API hash rotation is outside our control, see lessons/api_hash_rotation_20260421). Seeded from the 2026-04-21 WikiAgent trace: 10 unique cleared envs / 29 levels (aggregate per unique game_id, max over duplicate runs). CLI: `--seed`, `--promote`, `--dry-run`; exit 0/1/2 for PASS/FAIL/INPUT_ERROR. 10 unit tests in `tests/test_regression_gate.py`. Full suite 174/174.
- [x] **R6 — Live-env bench (formal)** (2026-04-21). Full 40-env comparison: Qwen 3 8B and 14B, both with R2 feature-rich DiscoveryReport + R3 universal dispatcher (67 strategies).

  | Run | Envs cleared | Total levels | Runtime | Gate verdict |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Baseline (pre-R2/R3, 8B) | 10/25 unique / 15/40 raw | 29 / 36 | 990s | — |
  | R6 8B + R2+R3 | 10/25 unique / 15/40 raw | 29 / **36** | 1066s | **PASS** |
  | R6 14B + R2+R3 | 13/25 unique / 21/40 raw | 23 / 34 | 1389s | FAIL (FT09, CD82 -6 each) |
  | R6 14B + selector v2 | 11/25 unique / 18/40 raw | 21 / 31 | 1080s | FAIL (+LS20 regression) |

  **Decision**: 8B stays primary. 14B regresses on FT09/CD82 because it ignores selector.md's fallback guidance — even after selector edits, 14B produced `[click_rare, seq_search]` for FT09 (seq_search hallucinated, not in the 67-whitelist) and missed lights_out/paint_game.
  
  **Lesson captured**: `.wiki/wiki/lessons/selector_is_advisory_not_enforced_20260421.md`. Wiki edits alone don't change LLM behavior reliably at 8B-14B scale; selector rules need a Python enforcement layer (next dev-cycle task). 14B is strategically better (env diversity, whitelist discipline, calibrated confidence 0.77 vs 0.93) but can't be promoted until Python enforcement lands.

**What is frozen by R1 that wasn't before**:
- No more ad-hoc "add an 18th strategy to the whitelist" edits — R3 covers all 74 uniformly.
- No more cold-prompt bench as decision input — R6 (live-env) is the only bench that decides.
- No more one-shot classify-and-dispatch — every run feeds R4 reflection.

**Legacy linear plan (kept for traceability, superseded by R1-R6)**:

<details>
<summary>Step 1-4 as written pre-restart (2026-04-20) — do not follow linearly</summary>

- Step 1 (Wiki seed): ~90% complete (65 pages, 70 MD files, 416KB). Carried forward into R4 reflection which appends new pages.
- Step 2 (Frame-only solvers): subsumed by R4 — reflection proposes refactors as they're needed, not in a hardcoded order.
- Step 3 (LLM + Wiki inference): subsumed by R2+R3+R6. The cold-prompt bench (2026-04-21: 8B 32%/40%, 14B 16%/40%) is a model-comparison artifact, not a deployment predictor.
- Step 4 (Independent cleanup): LF52/SK48 regression bisect still open; LoRA tuning deferred until R6 numbers say it's needed.

</details>

**Validation gates (R1-R6 framing)**:
- Gate A — R2+R3 regression: live-env ≥15 envs / 36 levels (2026-04-21 baseline), classification ≥45%.
- Gate B — R4 reflection effectiveness: ≥1 proposed change per run survives R5 gate; cumulative best_levels non-decreasing over 3 consecutive dev cycles.
- Gate C — R6 decision: live-env numbers with full features + full whitelist justify primary LLM choice. Target: ≥21/40 envs on v1+v2 combined (vs ensemble 28/40, WikiAgent 15/40).
- Gate D — Kaggle packaging: runtime ≤ 6h, VRAM ≤ 16GB, fully offline, frozen wiki + frozen strategies + frozen weights.

### R7 — Round Loop formalization (in progress)

Round 1 of the dev-time loop. Per user direction (2026-04-21), the R1-R6 skeleton is kept but the Qwen prompt and feedback schema are upgraded so each round produces actionable, structured input for the next round.

- [x] **R7a — Structured Hypothesis schema**. `features_missing` is now `list[FeatureGap(name, why_needed, derive_hint)]`; added `wiki_gaps: list[WikiGap]`, `wiki_needs: list[str]`, `doubt: str`. Parser (`_parse_feature_gaps`, `_parse_wiki_gaps`) accepts dict form; a single-commit tolerance for bare-string `features_missing` is FEEDBACK-GATED and deletable once all traces emit dicts. `scripts/analyze_trace.py` updated to group by `name` and surface a representative `why_needed` / `derive_hint` per feature.
- [x] **R7c — Qwen system prompt rewrite (English only)**. New sections: Output schema / Hard rules / Wiki search guidance / Feedback discipline / Expressing uncertainty / Carryover from prior rounds. `WikiAgent` now takes `round_num` + `round_learnings` and injects them into the prompt so every call knows which round it is and what the last round taught.
- [x] **R7e — Whitelist validation (`_validate_whitelist`)**. Filters hallucinated strategy names from primary/fallback before dispatch. Pins the 2026-04-21 R6 Qwen 14B FT09 `seq_search` regression as a FEEDBACK-GATED test.
- [x] **R7b — Graph-based wiki retrieval** (2026-04-21). `src/admorphiq/hypothesis/wiki_retrieval.py` with `GraphRetriever` that seeds from discovery signals (selector.md + reasoning core always; `game_types/hybrid.md` when both click and movement; `game_types/click.md`/`movement.md`/`concepts/merge_mechanic.md` by probe signature; `games/<TITLE>.md` by title match) then walks `[[backlinks]]` in keyword-scored order until the char budget is hit. Context budget raised 8K→16K (Qwen 128K context has room; seed pages saturated 8K before any link traversal). Smoke verified: SU15 now retrieves `concepts/merge_mechanic`, FT09 retrieves `games/FT09`, M0R0 retrieves `game_types/hybrid` + `games/M0R0` + `reasoning/hypothesis_check` — every env gets a different slice. 24 unit tests in `tests/test_wiki_retrieval.py`. Full suite 210/210.
- [x] **R7d — Round protocol** (2026-04-21). `scripts/round.py` with `start` / `finalize` / `learnings` subcommands writes `.omc/rounds/round_NNN/meta.json` + `notes.md`. `meta.json` captures goal, before/after summary (matching the regression gate's per-game_id aggregate), verdict (PASS/FAIL + per-env regressions/improvements lists), changes_made log, and prior_learnings_used. `round.py learnings N` replays prior rounds' takeaways — output is suitable for injection into WikiAgent's `round_learnings` prompt slot (R7c), closing the feedback carryover loop. 9 unit tests in `tests/test_round_protocol.py`. `.omc/rounds/round_001/` initialized for the first R7 bench.
- [ ] **R7f — Per-env multi-turn (optional)**. When primary fails, re-ask the LLM with the failure context before running fallback_stack. Cost: one extra LLM call per failed env.

186/186 tests passing (was 174, +11 R7 schema tests + 1 replaced features test). Smoke-tested end-to-end against a mock `HallucinatingLLM` that emits `seq_search` + structured `features_missing` / `wiki_gaps` / `wiki_needs` — filter strips hallucination, structured feedback round-trips to trace intact.

## Proven Approaches (from ARC-AGI-1/2 research)

1. **Discrete Program Search (DSL)** — define grid-transform primitives, search for compositions
2. **Test Time Training (TTT)** — fine-tune model on test examples at inference
3. **LLM as Hypothesis Generator** — generate candidate programs, verify against examples
4. **Active Inference** — real-time adaptation via few-shot fine-tuning (Jack Cole, 34%)
5. **Neurosymbolic** — neural perception + symbolic reasoning (Chollet's recommended direction)

## LLM Selection (Phase 8 Hypothesis Engine)

**Status**: 🔄 **Model undecided — pending Step 3-pre benchmark (Task #11)**. Do not pre-commit in scripts/docs; refer to the chosen model via config, not hardcoded imports.

**Why an LLM is needed**: Current high-scoring solvers depend on game-internal access (sprite tags, internal variables) that won't generalize to private test games. An LLM converts frame observations into rule hypotheses without source-code peek.

**Why the Karpathy LLM-Wiki pattern changed the calculus**: Earlier we favored Qwen 3 8B because LoRA fine-tuning was central. With Wiki-pattern zero-shot as the primary path, raw reasoning ceiling (where Gemma 4 26B MoE leads) matters more than LoRA ecosystem maturity. Decision now depends on measured Wiki-reading accuracy, not a-priori preference.

**Candidate comparison** (April 2026 specs):

| Model | Params | MMLU/Reason | Math (AIME) | VRAM (4bit, T4) | LoRA Ecosystem | Context | License |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|---------|---------|
| **Qwen 3 8B** | 8B dense | 8B-class top | Strong | ~5GB | 🥇 most mature | 128K | Apache 2.0 |
| **Gemma 4 26B MoE** | 3.8B active / 26B | 31B-tier (top) | 89.2% (top) | ~13GB | 🥉 growing | 128K | Apache 2.0 |
| **Gemma 4 E4B** | 4.5B effective | Solid w/ thinking mode | Mid | ~3GB | 🥈 | 128K | Apache 2.0 |
| Llama 3.1 8B | 8B dense | Behind | Behind | ~5GB | 🥇 mature | 128K | Llama license — ⚠️ check Kaggle compat |

**Benchmark rubric (Task #11)**:
1. **Game classification accuracy**: given first 20 discovery frames + action effects → predict correct `game_type` (movement/click/programming_puzzle/merge_puzzle/sokoban). 25-game labeled test.
2. **Strategy selection hit rate**: given classified type + top-3 similar `wiki/games/*.md`, pick strategy. Score = % matches to known-good dispatch.
3. **Latency**: tokens/sec on simulated T4 (local proxy: MPS or 4090 with T4 memory cap).
4. **VRAM headroom**: measured usage alongside loaded CNN (34M) + World Model (1.6M).
5. **LoRA viability** (secondary): only relevant if zero-shot underperforms.

**Decision output**: one primary model + one fallback. Config in `configs/llm.yaml` so swap is a one-line change.

**Do NOT do before benchmark**:
- Write `scripts/run_wiki_agent.py` with a specific model hardcoded
- Pre-download any single model's weights to Kaggle dataset
- Commit LoRA training scripts targeting one specific model

### Phase 7 (Ensemble + Analytical Solvers, Round 1 — 2026-04-20)

**Source of truth**: `scripts/ensemble_results.json` (2026-04-20 22:24–22:38, 826s runtime)

**Verified results**:
- v1 primary versions only (legacy 25-game metric): **23/25 games, 67/182 levels (36.81%)**
- All API-served envs (40 total, 12 games with 2 version hashes): **31/40 envs, 79/289 levels (27.34%)**

Perfect clears on v1 (5 games verified): **CD82 6/6, FT09 6/6, SB26 8/8, SU15 9/9, TN36 7/7**

Previous baseline (2026-04-10, backed up to `scripts/ensemble_results.20260410.json`): 22/25 games, 56/182 levels (30.77%)
Round 1 improvement: **+1 game (TN36), +11 levels** (TN36 +7, SU15 +2, KA59 +2)

Verified per-game depth (sorted):
| Game | Levels | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| SB26 | 8/8 | ✅ perfect |
| SU15 | 7/9 | ✅ |
| RE86 | 6/8 | ✅ |
| FT09 | 6/6 | ✅ perfect |
| CD82 | 6/6 | ✅ perfect |
| TU93 | 2/9 | ✅ |
| AR25 | 2/8 | ✅ |
| M0R0 | 2/6 | ✅ |
| SC25 | 2/6 | ✅ |
| KA59 | 2/7 | ✅ |
| WA30 | 2/9 | ✅ |
| CN04, TR87, LP85, DC22, SP80, G50T, BP35, S5I5, R11L, VC33, LS20 | 1 each | ✅ |
| **LF52** | **0/10** | ❌ regression (was cleared earlier) |
| **SK48** | **0/8** | ❌ regression (was cleared earlier) |
| **TN36** | **0/7** | ❌ never cleared in regression |

**Unverified post-regression commits** (commit messages, single-game tests only):
- 5e8562a: TN36 7/7 via `strat_tn36_puzzle` (uses `frame.zpzcmabenn`)
- b84839e: SU15 7→9 (L8/L9 hardcoded), KA59 2→4 (L3/L4 push mechanics)
- These boost CLAIMED score to 25/25 / 69 levels / 37.9%, but require fresh 25-game regression to confirm and to check whether LF52/SK48 still regress

### Lessons Learned
- **Frame structure mismatch**: Actual frames are multi-layer with variable layer count and int8 color indices, not fixed 16ch one-hot as initially assumed
- **Training bottleneck**: 440ms per action spent on training, only 8ms on inference -- training dominates runtime
- **Kaggle time budget is sufficient**: 6 hours allows 43K+ actions at current speed
- **Early diversity improved**: Action variety went from 1-2 types to 3-5 types, ACTION6 coordinate exploration realized
- **Change prediction has fundamental limits**: CNN converges to ACTION6-only preference, 500 actions still 0 levels cleared
- **StochasticGoose gap explained**: Same architecture but 0% -- root cause was coordinate scaling (/4096 missing), reward=0.3 (not binary), low train frequency
- **Game classification is key**: 25 games classified into movement(7), click(6), hybrid(6), transform(2), unknown(4) -- strategy should branch by type
- **Ensemble potential realized**: Graph/Diff/CNN/Analytical each clear different games — ensemble dispatch via feature-based triggers reaches 25/25
- **Analytical solvers are double-edged**: Game-internal access boosted score from 12% → 38% but creates Phase 8 generalization debt

## What Doesn't Work

- Direct LLM prompting alone (<5% on ARC-AGI)
- Pure memorization / pattern matching (tasks are novel by design)
- Ensembling existing solutions (doesn't generalize to private test set)
- Brute force search without heuristics (search space too large)
- **Change prediction as sole strategy** (tested Phase 2.5-3.5): CNN learns to predict which actions cause state changes, but converges to ACTION6-only preference without understanding game goals. 500 actions across 3 games, 0 levels cleared.

## Agent Behavior Rules

- **NEVER suggest stopping, pausing, or continuing in a "next session"**. Keep the infinite improvement loop running until the user explicitly says to stop.
- **NEVER say** "오늘 많이 했다", "다음 세션에 이어서 하자", "여기서 마무리하자", or similar phrases.
- The test→log→analyze→fix→retest loop runs indefinitely. Commit periodically but never use commits as a reason to stop.
- All 4 strategies (CNN, Ensemble, Graph, Diff) run in parallel. Never abandon one unless the user approves with clear justification.
- **Proactively keep CLAUDE.md in sync** with each phase commit — never wait for the user to point out stale stats.

## Dev-Time Round Loop (Phase 8)

Every improvement cycle is a **round** tracked under `.omc/rounds/round_NNN/`.
The protocol exists so ad-hoc bench runs don't lose provenance.

**Per-round files**:
- `meta.json` — structured metadata. `round.py start` seeds it with the
  current baseline snapshot; `round.py finalize` captures after-summary
  + verdict.
- `notes.md` — freeform work log. Claude Code appends to this during the
  round as changes are proposed, reviewed, and applied.

**Lifecycle** (runnable from the repo root):
1. `uv run python scripts/round.py start N --goal "..."`
2. (Qwen proposes → Claude Code applies → bench)
3. `uv run python scripts/round.py finalize N --trace scripts/wiki_agent_results_rN.json --takeaway "one-line lesson"`
4. If PASS, promote the baseline: `uv run python scripts/regression_gate.py --trace ... --promote`
5. Next round pulls the takeaway via `round.py learnings N+1` and
   injects it into WikiAgent's `round_learnings` prompt slot (R7c).

**Round principles**:
- The LLM (Qwen) is the **proposer**, Claude Code is the **implementer**.
  Never let Qwen write code or wiki directly — 8B-class models are
  reliable at spotting gaps but unreliable at integrating changes into
  an 8000-line codebase (measured in R4).
- Structured feedback only. `features_missing` and `wiki_gaps` entries
  without the R7a-required fields are parser-dropped, not coerced.
- Every round must produce a one-line `takeaway`. If the round taught
  nothing worth remembering, the goal was wrong or the bench is noise.
- Regression gate is non-optional. A round that fails R5 rolls back the
  proposing commit; the baseline only moves forward.

## Implementation Discipline (applies to every change)

**No speculative safety nets.** Do not add hardcoded constants, fallback
branches, or placeholder returns unless the task explicitly requires them.
If you find yourself typing `if x is None: return default` as a "just in
case," stop and verify whether `x` can actually be `None` at runtime — if
not, the branch is dead weight and obscures the real contract. Do not
invent scenarios the task did not ask for (negative budgets, missing
fields, partial configs). Trust internal callers. Validate only at genuine
system boundaries (user input, external APIs, file reads).

**No backward-compatibility shims by reflex.** Do not keep old argument
shapes, aliased names, or deprecation wrappers unless an external caller
actually depends on the old form. In a single-commit refactor, rename
together and move on.

**No placeholders.** `TODO`, `FIXME`, `# implement later`, and returning
`None`/`{}`/`""` from a half-written function are anti-patterns in this
repo. If a task isn't complete, the code isn't written yet — write it or
don't commit it. There is no "stub now, finish later" mode.

**Test code is proof of intent.** Every new test MUST carry a top-of-
function docstring stating:
  1. **Purpose** — what decision, invariant, or contract this test proves.
  2. **Expected feedback** — what its pass or fail outcome signals to the
     reader. A maintainer should understand the significance without
     reading the test body.

**Feedback-gated tests are deletable.** Tests that exist solely to validate
a one-off design decision (e.g., "does Qwen 8B still hallucinate
`seq_search`?") MUST be marked with a single-line `# FEEDBACK-GATED:`
comment directly above the test function. Once the feedback has been
collected and the decision is locked in, these tests ARE deleted — keeping
them around "just in case" is cruft that hides signal. Durable contract
tests (invariants, API guarantees, regression pins, schema validation)
are never marked and never deleted.

**When in doubt, prefer deletion over retention.** A clean test suite that
protects only durable contracts is worth more than a bloated suite that
protects every past experiment.

## Current Status (2026-04-20, Round 1 Regression Verified)

**Verified Score** (2026-04-20 re-run, `scripts/ensemble_results.json`):
- **v1 primary versions only (legacy 25-game metric)**: **23/25 games, 67/182 levels (~36.81%)**
- **All envs served by API (v1 + v2 hashes, 40 total)**: **31/40 envs, 79/289 levels (~27.34%)**

**Commit-claim verification**:
- ✅ **TN36 7/7** (5e8562a) — verified on v1
- ✅ **SU15 9/9** (b84839e) — verified on v1
- ✅ **KA59 4/7** (b84839e) — verified on v1
- ❌ **"25/25 games"** claim — actually 23/25 (LF52, SK48 still failed, no fix in any commit)

**Still failing in v1**:
- LF52 0/10 — silent regression from earlier clears (historical commit b1cbc91 had LF52 working)
- SK48 0/8 — silent regression from earlier clears (063a136 added SK48)

### 🔴 NEW: v2 Game-Hash Versions Expose Hardcoding Brittleness
The ARC Prize API now serves **12 games with 2 version hashes each** (25 base + 15 duplicates = 40 envs). v2 hashes likely preview the private-test-set style obfuscation — **hardcoded solvers tuned to v1 internals fail on v2**:

| Game | v1 result | v2 result | Failure cause (hypothesis) |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| SU15 | 9/9 ✅ | **0/9 ❌** | `game.hmeulfxgy/peiiyyzum/rqdsgrklq` var names differ |
| TN36 | 7/7 ✅ | **0/7 ❌** | `frame.zpzcmabenn` method name differs |
| RE86 | 6/8 ✅ | **0/8 ❌** | `vzuwsebntu/vfaeucgcyr/ozhohpbjxz` sprite tags differ |
| KA59 | 4/7 ✅ | **0/7 ❌** | hardcoded L1-L4 push sequences invalid |
| S5I5 | 1/8 ✅ | **0/8 ❌** | `myzmclysbl/zylvdxoiuq` sprite tags differ |
| CN04 | 1/5 ✅ | **0/6 ❌** | `zig3_A2A4` tuning doesn't transfer |
| SK48 | 0/8 ❌ | 0/8 ❌ | never cleared |

v2 passes (solvers robust enough):
- AR25, DC22, M0R0, R11L, SC25, SP80, TU93, VC33 — mostly generic strategies (bfs_state_space, seq_repeat, click_rare, spell_cast) = **frame-observation-based strategies generalize; game-internal-access strategies don't**

**Implication**: v2 is an effective proxy for private-test-set behavior. Phase 8 (frame-only solvers + LLM hypothesis engine) is no longer theoretical — the 9.47% score gap between v1 (36.81%) and v1+v2 (27.34%) quantifies the hardcoding debt today.

### Active TODO per Team

**Phase 8 Cleanup Team (highest priority)**:
- Remove all game-internal access from analytical solvers (see Hardcoding Debt below)
- Replace with frame-only object detection (color clustering, diff analysis)
- Replace hardcoded level solutions with online BFS/search

**LLM Integration Team (Phase 8)**:
- **First: Task #11 benchmark** — evaluate Qwen 3 8B / Gemma 4 26B MoE 4bit / Gemma 4 E4B 4bit on Wiki zero-shot classification + strategy selection. No implementation work until benchmark decides.
- Build hypothesis prompt template (frame description → rule guess → action plan) — model-agnostic, lives in `.wiki/wiki/selector.md`
- Pre-download winner + fallback weights to Kaggle dataset (no internet at inference time)
- LoRA training pipeline — ONLY if zero-shot benchmark reveals need AND winning model has mature LoRA tooling

**CNN Team (lower priority)**:
- LP85 only consistent clear — analyze what makes it solvable vs other games
- May be deprecated if LLM hypothesis engine subsumes its role

**Ensemble Team**:
- Push level depth on partially-cleared games (RE86, KA59, AR25, etc.) via better generic strategies
- Avoid adding new game-internal-access solvers (Phase 8 debt)

**Graph Team**:
- State expansion working (1000+ states after fix)
- Better ACTION6 coordinate exploration (16x16 → 32x32 grid)
- State hash downsampling (64x64 → 16x16)

**Diff Team**:
- Strongest single strategy (10 games)
- Improve movement game strategies (BFS + wall mapping)
- Click games need pattern recognition (click order)

### Game-Strategy Mapping (for final submission)
Each game should use its best-performing strategy. Build a meta-agent that:
1. Classifies game type in first 20 actions (discovery phase)
2. Selects optimal strategy based on classification
3. Falls back to other strategies if primary fails
4. **Phase 8**: invoke LLM Hypothesis Engine when frame-only solvers stall

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Game-Specific Hardcoding Debt (Phase 8 must fix)

Many high-scoring strategies currently depend on **game-internal access** that won't work on new games.

**Problem**: Analytical solvers read game source code internals (obfuscated variable names, sprite tags, internal state, hardcoded level solutions). These are specific to the 25 preview games and will NOT generalize to private test games.

### Affected strategies and their hardcoded dependencies

| Strategy | Game (cleared) | Dependency type | Specific hooks |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| `strat_lights_out` | FT09 6/6 | Sprite tags | `Hkx`, `NTi`, `bsT`, `ZkU` |
| `strat_paint_game` | CD82 6/6 | Hardcoded positions | `pqkenviek`, `ctwspzkygu` sprite x/y per level |
| `strat_sb26_sort` | SB26 8/8 | Game internals | portal/slot internal state |
| `strat_su15_vacuum` | SU15 9/9 | Game internals | `game.hmeulfxgy` (fruits), `game.peiiyyzum` (enemies), `game.rqdsgrklq` (goals) |
| `strat_tn36_puzzle` | TN36 7/7 | Direct internal call | `frame.zpzcmabenn(val)` to set bit-encoded program |
| `strat_re86_analytical` | RE86 6/8 | Sprite tags | `vzuwsebntu`, `vfaeucgcyr`, `ozhohpbjxz` |
| `strat_wa30_analytical` | WA30 2/9 | Sprite tags | `wbmdvjhthc`, `wyzquhjerd`, `pkbufziase` |
| `strat_s5i5_slider` | S5I5 1/8 | Sprite tags | `myzmclysbl` rotate buttons, `zylvdxoiuq` goals |
| `strat_ka59_sokoban` | KA59 4/7 | Hardcoded level solutions | per-level push sequences |
| `strat_tu93_maze` | TU93 2/9 | Hardcoded L1/L2 | move sequences |
| `strat_tr87_rotation` | TR87 1/6 | Hardcoded L1 | rotation values |
| `strat_ls20_grid` | LS20 ≥1 | Hardcoded L1 | move sequence |

**Estimated impact**: ~25-30% of current 37.9% score depends on these hooks. Conservative Phase 8 floor target: 21/25 games still cleared after refactoring (~22-25% score), then LLM hypothesis engine recovers/exceeds.

### Phase 8 Refactoring Plan
1. Each analytical solver must be converted to work through **official API only** (frame observation + actions)
2. Replace sprite tag reads with **frame-based object detection** (color clustering, connected components, diff analysis)
3. Replace hardcoded solutions with **online BFS/search** from frame state
4. Maintain a **discovery phase** where the agent learns game mechanics from first ~20 actions
5. Integrate **LLM Hypothesis Engine** (winner of Task #11 benchmark — Qwen 3 8B / Gemma 4 26B MoE / Gemma 4 E4B) to propose rule hypotheses from frame observations when search stalls
6. **Validation**: after refactoring, verify ≥21/25 games still cleared via 25-game regression test
7. Stretch goal: LLM-driven solvers exceed pre-refactor analytical scores

**Current approach is valid for**:
- Understanding game mechanics (research value — feeds LLM training data)
- Setting upper-bound performance targets (37.9% with internals = ceiling for frame-only attempts)
- Generating supervised solution traces for LoRA fine-tuning
